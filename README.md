# Personal Site

My slightly odd personal site.

Tells you a little about me, where to find some of my work. I decided to continue to have (my personal site) live on the bones of my early career work, I must still have a soft spot for jQuery in my heart, and there's something wonderfully simple about it all. There's no bundler, builder, state-management framework. Just some plain HTML, CSS, and the auld reliable jQuery.

Thanks for visiting :)
